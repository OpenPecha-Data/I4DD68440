PREFACE OF THE EDITOR
Alfonsa Ferrari (1918-1954), of Aquila, was one of the
best pupils of the Rome school of Buddhist studies, whose
guru is Professor G. Tucci. She studied Sanskrit with For-
michi, and Tibetan and the religions of India and the Far
East with Tucci, graduating at the University of Rome with
a thesis on the Arthaviniscaya (1), a small Sanskrit text
which summarizes in short formulae the essentials of Ma.
hayana. Afterwards she carried out post-graduate research
at the Oriental School of the University of Rome, at the end
of which she published a critical edition and translation of
the Paramitasamāsa of Aryaśūra (2). In 1946 and again
in 1948 she won a scholarship for research in Paris, where
she worked with Bloch, Renou, Bacot and Lalou. In 1952
she was appointed teacher of Sanskrit at the University of
Rome; but by that time she was already struggling against
the long illness which brought about her untimely end on

d'Italia, Memorie della Classe di Scienze morali e storiche, serie VIII, vol. IV
(1944). pp. 535-625.

the first day of 1954. We lost in her a very promising
junior scholar, those strictly scientifical mind and methods
and whose habit of pitiless self-criticism may have been an
obstacle to a larger production, but ensured a high scholarly
level for the little she chose to publish.
In 1946, upon her first departure for Paris, Professor
Tucci advised her to undertake the edition of the small
guide to the holy places of Central Tibet by mKyen brtse.
She worked at it for some years, intending to present it
as a thesis for the Ecole des Hautes Études in Paris. But
afterwards her interest flagged, as her attention was drawn
away to other subjects and as her illness began preying upon
her vitality. I remember discussing with her several points,
but vainly endeavouring to persuade her to finish a work
which she had begun with such keenness and continued with
such competence and care. Practically she ceased working
at it after 1951.
After her sad demise, upon request by Professor Tucci
and with the consent of the family of our lamented friend,
I took upon me to prepare the little work for the press.
Dr. Ugo Ferrari, Miss Ferrari's brother, handed over to me
all the papers she had left. When, after a long delay im.
posed by other pressing duties, I examined them, I found
to my surprise much less than I had expected. There was
no question of simply preparing a work for the press,
as we had expected (1). For the larger part the book had
yet to be written, and I felt very much in doubt whether it
was possible, and indeed advisable, to do so. Eventually
I decided in the affirmative, because I felt it as a duty to
(1) Professor Tucci had given expression to this hope in his obituary
notice of Miss Ferrari in Rivista degli Studi Orientali, XXIX (1954), pp. 158-159.



the memory of the friend and of the scholar, to see that her
last work should be completed and published.
The material I took over was the following:
1) The critical edition of slightly more than one half
of the text (f. 1-16), based on xyl. A and the ms.
2) A complete French translation.
3) The notes (in French) on the first six leaves of the
text (nn. 1-118 of the present edition).
4) Two card indexes, one for places and the other for
persons, with short unconnected and undigested jottings
(mostly quotations from DT, SP and TPS) and bibliogra-
phical indications.
5) A map, nearly, finished and ready for reproduction,
corresponding to Map A of the present edition.
My share in the preparation of the work has been the
following:
1) Writing the Introduction.
2) Checking and completing the critical edition of the
text, comparing it with xyl. B and changing its French
spelling into that used in the Serie Orientale Roma.
3) Turning into English the French translation, check-
mg it throughout on the original Tibetan and, when neces.
sary, modifying it in some minor points.
4) Translating into English the extant notes (nn. 1.
118), without change but with several additions; the latter
are placed between square brackets with my initials. So are
the notes by Mr. Hugh Richardson and Mr. Peter Auf-
schnaiter.



5) Working out the material of the card indexes, check-
ing it and completing it, in order to compile the notes for
the rest of the text (nn. 119-714). This was the longest
and most difficult part of the job. I tried to utilize to the
utmost the jottings of Miss Ferrari, but almost all of them
were only hints of the direction in which she intended to
turn her research. These hints I expanded and developed
as well as I could, trying to give the best possible expression
to her thought. But of course these notes have turned out
much shorter and more incomplete than those she had al-
ready written out. In the interest of science, and with the
moral certainty that the author would have approved of it,
I have supplemented this somewhat scanty material by in.
dependent work on a large scale, taking to contribution some
Tibetan texts which Miss Ferrari had only slightly perused
(VSP, KD) or not used at all (KTS, KG, TT, the Sa skya
Guide. Some problems, however, were insoluble with the
means at my disposal; and thus I turned for help and advice
to Mr. Hugh Richardson, the last British Agent in Lhasa.
A long correspondence ensued, which culminated in an one.
week stay of Mr. Richardson in Rome. I had thus the op.
portunity of discussing with him the whole of the notes. His
vast knowledge of things Tibetan, based on a residence of
nine years in the country, has proved invaluable, and this
book owes to him several descriptions of places, temples and
monasteries which he is the only European ever to have vi.
sited. He placed at my disposal xyl. B of the text (on which
see later). All the photos here published come from his
collection. In short, this book could never have appeared in
its present form except for his cooperation. By rights it
ought to appear under our joint editorship, were it not that
XII



Mr. Richardson modestly declined to allow his name to appear
on the cover. I can only record here my heartfelt thanks for
his liberal help and unfailing patience. In preparing some
of these notes I relied also upon the advice of my guru and
friend G. Tucci, drawing on his unique store of knowledge
of the artistic and religious history of Tibet. I have to thank
also Mr. Peter Aufschnaiter, now in Kathmandu, who read
through the text and sent me about a dozen short notes
on places known to him from personal experience. Thus
my share and that of my collaborators in the second half
of the book are rather large. Here too I was careful to mark
our contributions by placing them between square brackets
with our initials (H. R., L. P., P. A.).
6) Changing the spelling of Map A and thoroughly
checking it with the kind help of Mr. Hugh Richardson.
It must be remarked that the extant maps of the Survey of
India are unsatisfactory, not only on account of their often
incredibly distorted spelling, but also because of factual
mistakes and because many lateral valleys are still unsur.
reyed. In many places Mr. Hugh Richardson was the first
Westerner to set foot, and thus he was able to correct or to
mark the position of several monasteries and other sites,
which are shown in a grossly inaccurate way on the survey
maps or even left out as unexplored. The two outstanding
instances are 'Bri gun and the sNe mo valley.
7) Preparing maps B and C, again with the help of Mr.
Hugh Richardson
8) Preparing the Index.
I quite realize that I have overstepped the limits of a
mere editorship. But it was the only way of making the
XIII



work really useful for the scholarly world; and, as I have
said, I am sure that the author too would have tried to realize
this by all possible means, and therefore would have ap.
proved of my proceeding.
May this book serve to perpetuate the memory of its
author, a high-minded woman and a fine scholar whom a
cruel fate deprived of the promising career just opening to her.

INTRODUCTION
(by the Editor)
[The author of our text is known to us through a bio.
graphy entitled Je btsun bla ma t'ams cad mk yen cin gzigs
pa "Jam dbyans mkøyen brtse'i dban po Kun dga' bstan pa'i
rgyal mts an dpal bzan po'i rnam tar mdor bsdus pa no
mts ar u dum ba ra'i dgats al, 118 ff. It was written by
Ge bees Karma bkra sis cospel in his 81th year of age
water-dragon 1892 at Kun bzan bde cen od gsal glin, a
hermitage of Rin c'en brag. Being composed by a close
associate of mKyen brtse in the very year of the latter's
death, it is quite authoritative. It follows the usual pattern
of the Tibetan rnam t'ar (life of a holy man), and is divided
into three sections: pyi rnam tar (ff. 8a-78b: « external
biography », mainly an account of his monastic career and
of the texts he studied); nan rnam tar (ff. 79a-85a; in-
ternal biography >; a list of the esoteric cycles and initia-
tions, mostly rħin ma pa, which were imparted to him, and
by whom): gsan ba'i rnam tar (ff. 85a-117a; secret bio-
graphy »; an account of his mystical experiences and visions).
XIX



mK yen brtse was born in the fire-dragon year of the 14th
sexagenary cycle (1820) in Zal mo sgan, a district in mDo
k'ams. At the age of twelve he became a novice at T ar rtse
and received the monastie name of 'Jam dbyans mk yen
brtse'i dban po Kun dga' bstan pa'i rgyal mts an, which
I cite in the shortened from of mK yen brtse. In 1840 he
betook himself to Central Tibet and there, in the great rin
ma pa monastery of Min grol glin, he was ordained. The
rest of his life was very rich in spiritual experiences, but
poor in external events. He died in the water-dragon year
1892.
His work has been noticed several times by recent
writers. See IT, IV, 1, p. 45; Tucci, Lhasa, pp. 123-124;
PETECH, pp. 51, 85; H. HOFFMANN, Quellen zur Geschichte
der Bon-Religion, Mainz 1950, p. 147 et passim (under the
title given in xyl. B).
Three copies of the text have been utilized for preparing
the present edition. The first is a woodprint (xyl. A) from
De dge, very clear and on the whole fairly correct. It con-
tains 29 leaves of a rather small size (32 x 8 cm.), with six
lines per leaf. It belongs to Professor G. Tucci. The second
is a woodprint (xyl. B) from Lhasa, containing 40 leaves of
a small size (30 x 9 cm.), with six lines per leaf. It was given
by the incarnate of Min grol glin to Mr. Hugh Richardson,
who kindly lent it to me for some time. Except for the title,
it agrees word for word with xyl. A, and there are prac-
tically no variant spellings. Only at the end there is some
additional matter (as specified in its due place, see p. 32).
which is not a part of the Guide and therefore has been
omitted from the present edition. The third is a manuscript
(ms.) of unknown date and place, containg 34 leaves of a
XX



small size (e. 29 x 10 cm.), with 6 lines per leaf, written in
a regular and readable cursive (dbu med). It belongs to Pro-
fessor G. Tucci. Its accuracy is inferior to the two xyl, and
sometimes the text is badly corrupted: but it contains a
few passages not found in the print. The present edition
is based xyl. A, with readings of xyl. B and of the ms. in
footnotes.
As to the sources of our Guide, some of them are men-
tioned in the text itself: the bka gdams p'a cos (n. 14);
the Guide to Lhasa by the Fifth Dalai Lama (n. 44): the
Guide to the Four Monasteries by Nag dhan byams pa (n. 85);
the list of the images at bSam yas in the Padma t'an yig
(n. 132); the TT (n. 308); the Sa skya Guide (n. 482);
Tārānātha's guide of Jo nan (n. 565). Accordingly, the
author has based himself on the current dkar cfag (guides
to holy places) literature and, above all, on his personal
experience. We know from his biography that he toured
extensively Central Tibet and that he passed his life practi-
cally always on the move. Very many of the places listed
in the Guide are also mentioned in the biography, which
carefully notes year, month and day of his visit and the ini-
tiation he was granted or the vision he had there. Thus the
Guide is the result of wide reading and of a whole life
spent in pilgrimage. And therefore it is, so far as it can
be checked with the all too scanty data of Western travellers,
quite reliable and practical. We must indeed remember that
this was only partly intended to be a scholarly work; it had
also to serve a very practical purpose, explaining routes and
passes, temples and monasteries to the pilgrims going to the
holy places of Central Tibet. Of course the selection of the
places to be described is influenced by the author's Nin
XXI



ma pa background and by his leaning towards the Sa skya pa;
and it is interesting to note that some important dGe lugs pa
establishments are left out. But since the later are on the
average rather modern, this does not lessen the interest and
importance of our little text. - L. P.].

TRANSLATION



SHORT SUMMARY OF THE PURE NAMES OF SOME
OF THE HOLY PLACES AND IMAGES OF DBUS AND
GTSAN; CALLED THE SEED OF FAITH >>
May the flower of blessing be granted by the Three Je. 1. 1.b
wels, whose great glory rises above the spheres of samsāra and
nirvāņa, which resemble a white umbrella granting all pos-
sible desires and destroying through the shadow of compas-
sion the miseries of the living beings.
Now, dBus and gTsan, the country of the Buddha-field
(bhumi) completely purified by the most holy P'yag na
padmo (Padmapāņi), a region surrounded by glorious snowy
mountains, one of the famous Three Districts of Tibet, is f. 2.
called the District of the Pure Law. This [book] is merely
a list of the pure names of some of the holy places and
images, which in this district) alone, the ornament of the
Land of Snows, realized [the Law since its inception.
Two regions are distinguished in dBus; they are known
as dBu ru and g-Yo ru.
In the first place dBu ru. In its northern portion
there is Rwasgren of Byan, called the Hermitage
of the Conqueror, great residence of "Brom ston pa rGyal
ba'i byun gnas,' [resembling the heavenly garden (nan.
danavana) with its great divine trees. Very numerous sorts
of chapels are found there. Everybody is permitted to visit
the most outstanding of the sacred images contained in them,
viz. [the statue of] Jo bo 'Jam pa'i rdo rje (Manjuvajra), ge-
nerated from the seed of the great knowledge (jñāna) of



rDo rjee'an (Vajradhara) and his spouse (yab yum);' it is
like the Yid bžin nor bu (Cintamani jewel), which grants
the fulfilment of all the wishes expressed in this life and in
the life beyond. [Besides, there are the reliquaries of Bla ma
gSer glin pa," of Jo bo (Atīša) and of Brom ston. Apply.
ing for permission at the palace of the abbot (bla bran).
one is allowed to visit an image of Jo bo with bent head.
and other most important sacred images. There are also
many other objects to be visited in the neighbourhood of
the monastery, viz. the tree (planted at the birth] of "Brom
ston, the perennial source of ambrosia, ete. Behind this
[monastery], in the [hermitage) called Yan dgon below
the lion-like rock (brag sen ge’dra ba) [i.e. Sen ge brag]
there is a large number of marvelous (objects), such as the
chair on which rJe Rin po ce (Tson k'a pa) composed the
Lam rim." Near the monastery, on the P'a bon t'an («Rocky
Plateau)," there is the palace of the mKa' 'gro ma (Da.
kimi) gSan ba ye bes:" it is prophesied that by walking round
it to the left " while muttering the magie formula (mantra)
of bDe me og (Samvara), one will be reborn in the Orgyan
f. 3. (Uddiyāna) region," ete.
The temple called b Com lha k an gdon" was built
by the lord (dpon po) Mi dban" in a conspicuous point
(me btsa) of a central place.
The at gSer glin rgod ts an " there is a meditation
cell, which was the abode of sTag lun pa Sans rgyas yar
byon, etc.
At d Pal Tag lun tan there are, scattered every
where, an incalculable number of symbols of the three
planes." Foremost among them is a talking statue in the
cell of Tag lun tan pa Rin po e'e." In the upper storey
38



of the chapel there are many marvellous things, such as the
hairs of 'Brom ston which continue to grow, etc.
Then, having crossed the C ag pass, one enters the
'P'an yul [valley]” in dBu ru, the great country of
origin of the bka gdams pa doctrine. Although there is
here an incalculable number of residences of dge ba'i bấes
gñen (kalyānamitra) such as sNe’u zur pa," Po to ba,"
Pu e un ba" etc., some of them are difficult to find, even
if one goes in the innermost part of the mountains. Gene-
rally there is nothing but the empty site.
At Sa ra 'bum pa, residence of the widely famous f. 3-b
dge ba'i bšes gñen Sa ra ba," there are many blessing-be-
stowing stupas (mc od rten): and at Glantan, residence
of Glan tan ba rDo rje sen ge, there are blessing-bestowing
holy images, such as a talking image of Grol ma (Tärā), etc.
At dPal Nālendra," residence of the Kun mk yen
(« All-knowing > Ron ston een po," the relics of Ron ston
transformed into a treasury of jewels are shown. There are
(also the assembly hall, the Palace of the Eighteen (bCo
brgyad bla bran), the sleeping room of Ron ston) and
several blessing-bestowing symbols of the three planes. There
is also the chair of Ron ston, etc.
Then, having crossed the sGo" pass, [one arrives at]
Lha idan (Lhasa). In the sPrul pa'i gtsug lag kan"
there are the statues of] Jo bo," which is like the Cintā.
maņi jewel, Tugs rje cen po (Mahākaruņika) Ran byon
Ina Idan," Byams pa (Maitreya) Cos 'kor ma," Grol ma



(Tärä) Dar len ma ;" [together they are called the « Four
gods from whom light issues ». [All these images are placed]
above, below and in the middle of the temple; and in the
temple itself] together with its enclosure there is an im-
mense quantity of symbols of the three planes, as [it can be
seen) in the list (dkar c'ag) composed by the Fifth Dalai-
Lama (rGyal dban lna pa Rin po c'e)."
[There is the statue of] Jo bo Mi bskyod rdo rje (Akşo.
bhyavajra)" in the Ra mo c'e."
In the Potala," the palace of sPyan ras gzigs (Avaloki-
teśvara), one may visit from above, from below and in the
middle the golden reliquary (gser gdur) " of the Fifth Dalai-
Lama, [called] «Unique ornament of the World » (Dsam
glin rgyan gcig). Particularly, there are many marvellous
things, such as, in front of the door of the tomb (bum sgo).
a tusk of the Master when he took rebirth as an elephant;"
also the golden reliquaries of bsKal bzan rgya mts o, 'Jam
dpal rgya mts o, Lun rtogs rgya mtso, Ts'ul k rims rgya
mts o, mK as grub rgya mtso." In the chapel where is the
image of] Jo bo Lokeśvara," there is also a statue of Je
btsun Grags pa " called mDse t'od ma (<with a leper skull»),
the terracotta statue of K'a c'e Pan e en,the image of
Tan rgyal" called 'Ja' ts on ma (< with the rainbow »),
the footprints of Orgyan Rin po ce” on the summit of
the Gun tan pass," and a great number of other extraor-
dinary esoteric images. Below, there are the sleeping cave"
of the Cºos rgyal (Religious King) Sron btsan sgam po and,
besides, the chapels decorated in relief (blos slon k'ar)
of the Dus 'kor (Kälacakra) and of the gSan "dus (Guhya-
samāja) and an endless number of other chapels. Generally
people are not allowed to see them."



On the 1Cags po ri," the hill sacred to Pyag na rdo rje f. 4-b
(Vajrapāni), there are several blessing-bestowing sacred sym-
bols, such as the coral [statue of] Tse dpag med (Amitäyus)
caused to be made by the great Siddha (Grub een) Tan
ston rgyal po, the mother-of-pearl [statue of] Tugs rje c'en
po (Mahäkaruņika, Avalokitesvara) and the turquoise (sta-
tue of] sGrol ma Tārā."
Then there is the sleeping cave of the Cos rgyal Sron
btsan sgam po, called Brag lha klu p ug. In that place,
where later "Pags pa 1Ce sgom" obtained the mystic reali-
zation (siddhi) of Tugs rje cen po, there are also several
symbols of the three planes.
Behind the Potala there is also the hill sacred to "Jam
dbyans (Mañjughoşa), called Bon ba ri." The chapel which
is on its summit is the chapel of Ge sar."
In other places such as Kun bde glin," bsTan rgyas
glin, Ts'o smon glin," bži sde," dMar ru old and new,
etc., there are several sacred symbols of the three planes;
and on the four cardinal points (of Lhasa?) are the stone
images of the Rigs gsum mgon po," famous on account of
their having been set up at the time of the Cos rgyal."
On the opposite side of the river, in front) of Lhasa,
there is Grib Tse me og glin," residence of K'a cen Ye f. 5a
bes rgya mtso."
Near Lhasa there is the great monastery of 'Bras
spuns," divided into four colleges;[there) and in the great
assembly hall an enormous quantity of symbols of the three
planes is found. [Among them the foremost is an image
of Jigs byed (Bhairava)," famous because the marvellous
42



relics of the Rwa Lotsawa" are inside it. In the dGaldan
po bran" is the talking [image of] sGrol ma, the protecting
deity of Jo bo rje (Atīša), other very remarkable sacred
images and the little sleeping cell of 'Jam dbyans e os rje
of 'Bras spuns. In the printing house there are many print-
ing blocks, such as those of the opera omnia (gsun ”bum)
of rJe Rin po c'e (Tson k'a pa) and of the first and second
Dalai Lamas."
To the north of Lhasa lies Se-ra." divided into two
colleges; there and in the great assembly hall" is an end-
less number of sacred symbols of the three planes. Foremost
among them, being also the chief sacred image of the Byes
pa college, is the dagger of Grub t'ob Dar "pyar." There is
also a talking statue of the esoteric form of Ta mgrin (Ha.
yagriva) in its terrifying aspect," ete. Generally speaking,
the three great monasteries of Se [ra]. Bras (spuns and
dGa' [ldan], which along with bkra bis lhun po are called
5.b «the four great monasteries », are very clearly described.
together with the upper and lower Tantric schools (rGyud
stod smad), in the very detailed list composed by P ur bu
leogs byams pa."
In the lower part of the valley near Se ra, at P a bon
k'a," a spot where the Cos skyon Sron btsan sgam po medi-
tated, there are many meditation caves and blessing-bestowing
sacred symbols of the three planes. This place is famous
as the second Devikoța " among the 24 holy places. Besides.
there are very numerous hermitages, such as dGe 'pºel
ri k‘rod " of "Bras spuns, sGrub k'an rtse" of Se ra,



P ur bu leog, mK ar rdo ri krod," cu bzan ri
k rod," Brag ri" old and new, etc.
Going on upstream from Lhasa, to the north of the
gTsan poº [lies) Brag yer pa." In the Zla ba p ug cave,"
there is a statue (sku ts ab) of Orgyan Rin po e'e and many
self-originated [images." Then there are] Do rje pʻug,
Dril bu pug, and the mountain cave of the eighty siddhas
of Yer pa." In the main temple, on the plate of the offerings
to the Jo bo, there is a picture painted with blood from
the nose of Jo bo rje. There is also the blessing-bestowing
chapel of the Sixteen Arhats, etc.
At 'Brom stod, in the sleeping cave of għan Lot-
sawa " there is an excellent image of mGon po žal.
Going on to the south of the gТsan po there is
the residence of Bla ma Žan, called Ts'al gun t'an.
It contains a great stūpa, a cell of the terrifie deities (mgon
k'ar) dedicated to mGon po P yag bži pa," and many other
sacred symbols of the three planes.
Then, going upwards, at dGe ldan rNam par rgyal
ba'i glin " in "Brog there are countless symbols of the
planes, foremost among which the globe-shaped relics of
rJe Rin po c'e;" and also on the encircling path outside
[the monastery] numerous self-originated [objects can be
shown.
Going upwards from here, there are numerous holy
places and images, such as [the place of] the Cos skyon
Ts'ans pa Duń i od can *** of La mo;" K'ri k'an in



rGya ma; " Ka tsal in Mal gro;" Żwa'i lha kan"
in dBu ru; "Bri gunrdson gsar; Yan ri dgon;" 'Bri
gun til; as far as Ti sgrom in gžo stod." Five or
six days are needed for their visit.
On the other side of dGa ldan, to the north of the
t. 6.b g Tsan po, there is Lo, the residence of the Sems dpa'c en
po," ete.
From dGaldan, crossing a pass, one arrives at
g- Ya' ma lun 120 in the bSam yas region, the meditating
place of the great Lotsawa Vairocana." Here his meditation
cave, images of Orgyan (Padmasambhava), life-giving water
etc., are found.
From here, having passed sNas mgo "and going
downwards, behind bSam yas, at Brag dmar mGrin
bzan *** which is the birth place of king Kºri sroń [lde
brtsan), there are temples and sacred symbols built anew
with most pure materials.
In the Cos 'k®or een po of Sam yas there is the

From Zans ri mk®ar dmar crossing the river by boat one
arrives at rTse t'an.216 There are some monasteries, and
one can visit remarkable things, such as the Tub pa gser
glin ma," i.e. the cave which serves as assembly hall for
the Na me od pa, etc.
In a mountain gorge of Tse tan lies the famous b Sam

tsogs pa and gTsan Cos lun tsogs pa. " It is said that
among the sacred symbols existing in all these monasteries
there are remarkable objects, such as the clay statue of the
Pan c'en, his alms bowl ete.
Of the so-called three stūpas and three sacred places of
Yar klun," the three sacred places are K'ra "brug, Sel
brag, *** and the third, although said by some to be Ras cºun
p'ug, *** is generally accepted and recognized as Yum bu gla
sgan." The three stūpas are those known by the names of



rTag spyan 'bum pa, dGon tan 'bum pa and Ts'e e'u 'bum
pa.***
If one marches from FTse tan straight to the interior
of Yar kluń, [one finds) Kra 'brug in the noble g-Yu
ru. Here, in the main temple bkra sis byams sñoms, the
most important images are: a stone statue of the rGyal ba
*. 10-b rigs lna (the Panca Tathāgata), *** which the Cos rgyal Sron
btsan sgam po fetched from Zo dan gans po ri; a Grol ma

called dBu lna ma " which purifies sins; and other blessing-
bestowing [objects). Near the K'ra 'brug temple is the

Going up the valley from Kfra 'brug, there lies the
place called « The Preaching Chair of Sa skya Pandita >>;**
and in the Yum bu bla mkar," which was the palace
of the Cos rgyal T o to ri gñan btsan, there is the Jo bo
Nor bu bsam 'pel ** and the protecting deity gNan po gsan

was made by order of dGe bses skor c'en " of the bka?!
gdams pa sect and is famous because it contains the left eye
11.of the Bodhisattva rTag tu nu.*
Above this place is the spot where "Brog mi dPal gyi

Yar lha sam po Gans kyi ra ba."
Generally speaking, behind Yar kluń in upper and lower
50



Lho k'a ** lie E yul, where knowledge (rig pa) arose,
Ñal, *** Lo ro, ** Gro sul 28 and Byar. Then in due
order come Tsa ri etc., and then one arrives in Koń po.
Descending from the above-mentioned Tag spyan "bum

Pts al 4 pass there is a most remarkable cemetery together
with a stūpa. Elsewhere in the neighbourhood there is the
secret cave of mTs'o rgyal;** and behind it, to the left, there
is Padma sel pug, 97' famous as the place where Orgyan glin
pa ** found a treasure; and other places. But they are
distant.
At the end of the descent from Sel brag there is bТsan
tan g-yu yi lha kan, founded by queen Nan tsul
byan cub, *** the mother of K'ri sron [lde brtsan); and
close to it is Cog ro Tse cu 'bum pa, from which
life-giving water (ts'e cºu) really issues on the fifteenth day
of the month (i.e. at full moon).



Behind it, on the summit of the hill called bt-antan
Lha ri sgo bži, ** is the place where the first Cos rgyal
(Religious king) of Tibet, għa' k'ri btsan po,*** came down
from heaven.
Progressing from the above-mentioned Gun t'an 'bum
4. 12a pa in the direction of 'P'yons rgyas, there are the sPa
gor monastery " which was the residence of Vairocana,
the meditation cave Rog pa rtsa," ete. Visitors are rare
because these places, although situated on the route, are
unknown to everybody.
On the route which leads upwards from here, at Sol
nag T an po e e, which was the residence of the dge
ba'i bốes gñen (kalyānamitra) K'u ston brTson 'grus g.yun
drun, there are numerous ancient sacred symbols, such

fectly understood the Prajñāpāramita in 20,000 slokas (Ni
kºri) and who was a disciple of mKas grub dGe legs dpal
bzan," there are numerous blessing-bestowing symbols of
the three planes.
Near this school there is the castle of 'P'yin pa sTag
rtse, which was formerly the palace of the famous sde pa
of 'Pºyons rgyas " descending from a family of Za hor,**
and was the place where later the Fifth Dalai-Lama was
born. Slightly above this, there is a a bas-relief image of



the corpse of the Cos rgyal Sron btsan sgam po: it is called f. 19-b
Ban so dmar po (Red Tomb »). The tomb itself is in
the shape of an earth mound. Above it are the chapel built
by Nan Man lun pa " and some great blessing-bestowing
symbols of the three planes.
In the upper part of the Don mk ar valley," which

Kun mk yen "Jigs med glin pa," where are a stūpa con-
taining the pill-shaped relics of the Kun mk'yen, and re.
markable symbols of the three planes.
Slightly above the tomb of Sron btsan sgam po in
Pyons rgyas, lies 'P'yons rgyas dPal ri, the resi.
dence of the 'Pren po gTer e en Ses rab 'od zer, an
incarnation of Vairocana. Although formerly this was the
most important college of the rin ma pa sect, being called
rDor smin dPal ri, nowadays the name is nothing but
simply Dpal ri dgon. There are the image of Guru Rin po

symbols of the three planes.
Generally speaking, in this direction lies the sPyan
g-yas 8 valley; here is the sPyan g-yas Lha kan,"
where the "Gos Lotsawa głon nu dpal 15 went to school; 6. 13-
and besides there are many side valleys (lun lag), such as

Lotsava Rin e en bzan po in his residence of mto Idin; they discussed
together the translation of the Prajña paramita, and Atiśn invited the Lotsava
to join him; but the latter refused on the ground of his great age (85).
Atīsa stayed three years in mNa' ris, and while preparing for the return
journey to India he was met by Brom ston, who placed himself at his
service. Being asked to make a journey to dBus, he accepted and came to

had followed him; DT, Ca f. 8a-b [= ROERICH, P. 257). Afterwards he
toured the principal monasteries of that region: mCims p'u, Lhasa, Ne t'an.

his teaching to "Brom ston with the charge of not allowing it to die out..

Ra sa 'Prul san gi g'Tsug lag kan (TOUSSAINT, P. 399: Buston, p. 185.
where Ras stands for Ra sa). The name of Lhasa is said to be a modification
of Ra sa, as a consequence of the erection of the temple. It was the first
Buddhist temple in Tibet, built by Sroi btsan agam po at the request of his
first wife, the Nepalese princess. BUSTON, p. 185, gives some information on
the work which was necessary before the building was begun, on account of
the marshy nature of the ground. For details see also GRÜNWEDEL, p. 21 et
seq. As to the date of its foundation, nothing certain can be said, as the
Tibetan sources known to me are silent on this subject. Waddell's dates are
contradictory. Thus in Lamaism, p. 23, he gives following Bushell the date
of 644, and adds that the temple was built four years after the marriage of
the king with the Chinese prineess; in Lhasa, D. 362, he mentions the date
652. Of course the more likely date is the first one, as Sron btsan sgam po
died in 649 (J. BACOT, F. W. THOMAS, Ch. TOUSSAINT, Documents de Touen.
houang relatifs à l'histoire du Tibet, Paris 1940-46, p. 29), and his marriage
with the Chinese princess goes back to 641. The temple lies in the centre of
the town and was built on the model of the temple of Vikramasila (SP.
p. 168). DSGL, 32 (= VASILYEV, p. 25), says that it had three stories. De.

31 The Jo bo c'en po is the most famous statue of Tibet, the palladium
of the Tibetans. It represents the Buddha at the age of 12, and was brought
to Tibet by the Chinese wife of Sroh bsan sgam po. The Tibetan legend
maintains that it was made in Magadhu by Viswakarman, in the time of the
Buddha himself. From Magadha it is said to have been brought to China
after many vicissitudes (GRÜNWEDEL, PP. 35-36). As a matter of fact, ac
cording to a tradition noted down by Professor Tucci, the existing statue is
not the original one; the latter was destroyed in 1717 by the Dsungar in.
vaders. And indeed, the style of the work exeludes both an ancient date
and an Indian origin; cf. WADDELL, Lhase, p. 369. For a description and a
rather bad photograph see E. H. C. WALSH, The image of Buddha in the
Jo-to-Khang Tem ple at Lhasa, in JRAS 1938, Pp. 533.540. Sce also DAS,
Journey, pp. 201, whose description of the statue is much more flattering
than that of Waddell and other travellers. Being considered as the symbol
of the new religion, the Jo bo went through many accidents, according to
the religious policy of the Tibean court. At first it was placed in the
mo c'e temple. At the death of Sroń bisan sgam po it was brought into the
"Prul sau temple (BUSTON, P. 185; SP, p. 169). GRÜNWEDEL, pp. 38-39,
says that because of the Chinese invasion the statue was concealed under the
gate of the Ra mo e e; the Chinese wife of Krisroh Ide brtsan saw it by
means of her prescience and caused it to be dug out and brought into the
"P'rul snan. Under the reign of Krisron lde brtsan the enemies of Bud.
dhism wanted to send the statue back to China, but as they were unable to
move it, they buried it under heaps of sand. Afterwards it was dug out and
sent to sKyid groß in Man yul (BUSTON, pp. 186-187; DT. Ka I. 21a - Ror-
1]). In the times of Padmasambhava it was brought back to the
"Prul nan (DT, Ka f. 22a [= ROERICH, p. 44]). Under Glan dar ma it
underwent another burial (BUSTON, p. 198), after which it was finally replaced
in the Prul snan.
** This famous statue of the eleven-faced Avalokitesvara was caused to
be made by Sroh btsan sgam po after his meditation on the god at P'bon
k'a (SP, p. 168). The name of Ran hyon lna given to this statue is due to
the fact that the Nepalese sculptor entrusted with the work declared that it
had sprung into being as if by spontaneous generation, giving out two rays
of light which represented Amstakundali and Hayagriva; these two deities
together with the spirits of the king and of his two wives are the five acolytes
(Ina Idan) of the god. BUSTON, p. 184, on the contrary says that the statue
was brought to Tibet from Southern India. C. KD, A 1. 60-b; GRÜNWEDEL,
p. 24; Das, Journey, pp. 203-204.
41 This statue of Maitreya was brought to Tibet by the Nepalese wife
of Sron btsan ngam po. It was believed to be the projection of the spiritual

370. It had been brought to Tibet by the Nepalese wife of Sron btsan sgam
po. But the Guide of the Fifth Lalai Lama translated by Grünwedel (p. 67)
says it was then no longer in existence.
** This means that the images were placed in the three storeys of the
temple.
4 Blo bzan rgya mts'o, the Fifth Dalai-Lama (1617-1682), was the real
founder of the temporal power of the dGe lugs pa. He was an outstanding
personality both in the political and in the cultural field. He united Tibet
under bis sway and reformed its administration. He caused new
be built and decayed monasteries to be restored. His literary output knew

his famous chronicle. He sponsored the Tibetan translation of Pāṇini. See
SP, p. 303, and above all TPS, pp. 57-76, 133-136. The guide to Lhasa, here
mentioned, was composed in 1647; it has been translated by GRÜNWEDEL
under the title Die Tempel von Lhasa, in the Sitzungsberichte der Heidelberger
Akademie der Wissenschaften, Phil.- Hist. Klasse, 1919, n. 14.
* This statue of Aksobhyavajra was made by Vibvakarman (GRÜNWEDEL,
pp. 66.67) and was brought into Tibet by the Nepalese wife of Sron btsun
Kgam po. It represents the Buddha at the age of eight and is called the Jo
bo e un ba, Little Jo bo (SP, p. 168; cf. note 39). It was at first enshrined
in the "Prol snan, and later exchanged its place with the Jo bo e'en po:
BUSTON, p. 185. DAs, Journey, p. 207, thinks that the statue now extant
in the temple may be very ancient.
16 The Ra mo e'e temple was founded by the Chinese wife of Sron btsan
*gam po in the second quarter of the 7th century, at about the same time as
the "P'rul sman (cf. note 38). It contained at first the statue of the Jo bo
e'en po, which then, upon the death of the king, was transferred to the
"Prul man. The legend says that the place where the temple was built
communicated directly with hell. It is also said that the Chinese princess
was buried in this temple. The building has three storeys and is untidily
kept. Today the temple is entrusted to the care of monks, part of whom are
ser k'yim (married monks). It became long ago connected with one of the
two Tantrie schools of Lhasa, the Gyad stod (as pointed out by the interli.
near note rgyted stod pa in the xyl.); the other is the rGyud smad near the
ru monastery. The Gud stod is in a quite distinct building near and
to the east of Ra me e'e. Gyud smad is still further east by north. . H.R.).

47 The building of the present residence of the Dalai Lamas was probably
commenced in 1645 by the V Dalai-Lama, and was continued by his son Sans
Tgyas rgya miso, regent (ide arid) of Tibet. The date 1645 is found in the
guide to Lhasa by the same V Dalai-Lama (GRÜNWEDEL, p. 75), where we
are told that the foundations of the palace were laid down on the first day
of Vaisakha (Ah month) of sin bye 1645. The Re'u mig too gives 1616 as
date of foundation, but it adds that the palace with nine storeys was built by Saus
rgyas rgya mis o in 1694 [This is probably the central part of the Potala, which
in its present shape was not yet existing in 1661, when the Jesuits Griber
and D'Orville passed through Lhasa. - L.P.). SP, p. 165, and DSGL. P. 33
(= VASILYEY, p. 26), consider Sans rgyas rgya mts alone as the builder of the
palace; this is impossible, because it would necessitate pushing forward the
foundation date to after 1679, when Sans rgyas rgya mti'o was appointed
sde srid (SP, p. 165; TPS, p. 656). This attribution is evidently due to the
important works carried out by him in the palace, in continuation to those
of his father. The palace rises upon the hill called formerly dMar po ri
(Red Hill) and now usually styled Potala, a corruption of Potaraka, a hill
in Sindh which was believed to be the residence of Avalokitesvara. The name
Potala is hardly used by the Tibetans. They call it Tse, or Tse Pobran.. H.R.
Already Sron btsan sgam po about 637 had built upon the dar po ri a white
palace with 11 storeys (according to DSGL, loc. cit.), which was the residence of
the Tibetan kings and which was struck by lightning in the reign of Kri
sron Ide brtsan (DT, K, f. 216 [= ROERICH, p. 43]). Some sources say that
this ancient palace still exists and can be distinguished by its very colour
from the later buildings, which are red. But SCHULEMANN, p. 150, says that
the V Dalai Lama caused all the ancient buildings existing on the dar po
ri to be demolished, keeping their foundations only. The Red Palace (P'
braš dmar po) has, as stated by the Tibetan texts as well (S.P. p. 165) nine sto.
reys: it forms the central part of the building. The DSGL, loc. cit., alone states
that the palace had 13 storeys. Like the Indian hill Potaraka, the Potala too
is considered as the residence of Avalokitesvara, incarnated first as Sron
btsan sgam po and then as the Dalai Lama. According to DT, P'a f. lb
ROERICH, P. 1006), the name Potala would go back to the times of Sron
btsan sgam po, i.e. to the 7th century. The name Po-ta-riis mentioned also
in the 11th century: DT, K, f. 4b (= ROERICH, p. 71). The wall paintings
inside the palace were commenced in 1648 (and therefore the Guide of the
V Dalai-Lama does not mention them); this supports the contention that the
palace was finished by the Dalai Lama himself. During the 18th century
important works of repair and enlargement were carried out, and some new
88



buildings were added to the palace. CE. DAs, Journey, pp. 220, 229: WADOKLI.

1815), V (1816-1838) and XI (1838-1855) Dalai Lamas. In this list the name
of the VI Dalai Lama Ts'ana dhyanis rgya mts'o (1683-1707) is missing, as
he died on the way to Peking in the Kukunor xone and his body was denied
by the Chinese the burial fitting to his rank. Nowadays two other ser adun
exist in the Potala, those of the XII and XIII Dalai Lamas, the last one being
the richest of all; Tucci, Lhasa, p. 92. For the lives of the Dalai Lamas the
best account is still W. W. ROCKHILL, The Dalailamas of Lhasa, in Toung Pao
XI (1910), pp. 1.98, based on Chinese sources; but some dates should be
corrected. Cl. also G. SCHULEMANN, Die Geschichte der Dalailamas, Heidel

91 This is the gilt statue of Avalokitesvara venerated in the main chapel
of the Potala. The Guide of the V Dalai-Lama says that this sandal-wood
statue of Lokesvara was discovered by the monk Akaramati in Nepal (GRÜN.
WEDEL, PP. 73-74). It was brought from Lhasa into the Potala at the time
of the foundation of the palace (GRÜNWEDEL, p. 75). Cf. also WADDELL, Lhasa,

53 The Great Kashmiri Pandit (Ka e'e Pap d'en) Sakyasribhadra has
a long biography in the DT, Ba ff. 1b-lla (= ROKRICH, pp. 1063-1071). Most
interesting is the complicated calculation by which the author of the DT
establishes the birth date of the Pandit, on the basis of the chronological
data left by the Pandit himself and by the Kro p'u Lotsava, who invited
him to Tibet. According to the DT, Sakyusri was born in me lug 1127, be-
came a monk in sa abrul 1149, arrived to Tibet at the age of 78 in til byi
1204, remained there ten years, went back to Kashmir in sin kyi 1214 and
died at the age of 99 (Tibetan reckoning) in sin bya 1225. During his stay
in Tibet he visited several monasteries. From Pag ri, the place where he
entered Tibet, he went to Lhasa stopping en route at ryan romGar mo.
Kro p'u (where he expounded the Asfasahasrila, the Prātimokşastatra and
the Sütrantalamkara), "T'ur p'u (mTs'ar p'u) and at the Srin po ri, where
he translated some texts and expounded several cycles of Tantrie intructions.
He travelled also in the regions to the south-east of Lhasa: bam yas, 'C'ima
pu, gNal, Loro, Tan po e'e, Gun ar to the south of Yar kluis), Glo bo
etc., after having visited Rwa ngren in the north. Having returned to Kashmir,
he busied himself with the restoration of temples and images and with the
diffusion of the Doctrine. It is interesting to note that the biography of
the Pan c'en quoted by Tucci (TPS, pp. 335-336), although perfectly agreeing
with the account in the DT both for the dates of arrival and of visit to the
several monasteries, and for the events which preceded and accompanied the
journey of the Pay c'en in Tibet, disagrees concerning the dates of birth
and death. According to this biography, the Pan c'en was born in bill glan
1145 and died 29 years after his return from Tibet, i.e. in 1243. As already
remarked by Tucci, the only unlikely statement in the DT is the date of
birth, which is pushed too far back and which compels us to admit that Pan
e'en arrived in Tibet at the age of 78. On the other side it must be noted
that the DT inveighs against one sPyi bo lhas pa, who in his works had
dared to affirm that the Pan c'en had arrived in Tibet at the age of 65.
See also DT, C'a f. 9b, Na f. 37b, Na f. 13a (→ ROKRICH, Pp. 319, 485, 893).

54 Tan rgyal is Tan ston rgyal po (1385-1464), who is famous throughout
Tibet as the saint builder of iron bridges (lcags sam). The greater part of
the Tibetan bridges is attributed to him and his images are venerated in many
temples side by side with those of the Masters of the Law. He founded the
hermitage of Pal Co bo ri, in front of the celebrated iron bridge on the

called to Tibet by king Krisrou Ide brtsan, on the advice of the Indian
scholar Säntiraksita, in order to subdue the demone who opposed the con

59 Tucci, Lhasa, p. 93, says indeed that people are not admitted to visit
all the chapels in the Potala except on the 4th day of the 6th month.
During the rest of the year most of the chapels are closed and some are
even sealed. [There are a few other days when visits are allowed, e.g. in the

o The Cugs po ri (Iron Hill) is opposite to the Potala, to the South
East. On its summit is a famous temple, attached to a medical school (1Cags po
Ti Vaidurya grwa ta'an or sMan risis k'an), which the Guide does not mention.
This is rather surprising, as it does not fail to list the three statues
which the temple contains. C. SP, p. 308, who mentions also a meditation
place of U rgyan pa (Padmasambhava) situated behind the school; DSGL,

were, the chapel of the medical school (sman risis k'ari), which conducts its
practical activities in a building on the N.E. of the Tsug lag kan about
1. miles from the ICags po ri. - H.R.).
GRÜNWEDEL, PP. 70-71, lists exactly the same statues, with the addition
of the image of a lion, consecrated by Tan ston rgyal po. WADDEL, Lhard,

4 More correctly Boh bo ri. It is a hill to the south-west of the Potala
and very close to it (N. 11 in the plan of Lhasa in WADDELL, Lhasa, p. 331).
The DSGL, p. 33 (- VASTLY V, p. 27) gives a very incorrect spelling the
mount sacred to Manjusri, called sBra ma ri. The best spelling is that of
the V Dalai Lama : Bon buri (GRÜNWEDEL, p. 71): but today the hill is
called Bon bori (Tucer, Lhasa, p. 73: Bompori). (Colloquially it is called
Par mari, and I was told this refers to a scrubby sort of bush (spar ma)
with which the hill is covered. But the spelling Bar ma ti is found in an
inscription of the Ch'ing dynasty at Kun bde glin; see n. 65. . H.R.L.
6 The Ge sar lha k'an is, according to WADDELL, Lhasa, pp. 331 and 334)
a small temple in the Chinese style. The DSGL p. 33 (- VASILTEV, p. 27)
describes it as «the chapel of the war god (dGra lha) of Mahacina. Yun

that the date is the 58th year of Ch'ien-lung (1793). There is also an in.
scription in Chinese and Tibetan on a stone tablet on the Souther side of
Kun bde glin, dated Wood-Tiger year, the 59th of Chien-lung (1794). It
records that a tha k'ar was built by the Chinese authorities on Bar mari

Together with bsTan rgyas glin, Tso smon glin and Ts'e me og glih it formed
the group of the four Royal Monasteries of Lhasa. The regent of Tibet during
the minority of a Dalai Lama was, according to Chinese regulations, chosen
from among the abbots of the 4 glint, corresponding to the four mythical
continents. [The Tibetans never recognized this limitation, which was appa-
rently imposed in order to enhance the Chinese control upon Tibetan affairs
during the minority of a Dalai Lama. - H.R.). Accordingly, the word Ta
Is'ags added in the wyl. as a note to the name of the monastery indicates
that Kun bde glin was the seat of the Ta tsage (or Da Is'ag) Qutuqtu,
two of whom were regents of Tibet: the first one for the VIII and IX

TbsTan rgyas glin was the most important of the four glin of Lhasa.
It was situated in the northern section of the city, within the walls, to the
south-west of the Ra mo e'e (n. 11 in the plan of Sh. Ch. Das, Journey,
p. 216). [The nole De mo in the xyl. hints at the fact that betan tayas
glin was the seat of the Demo Qatuqtu, who was thrice regent of Tibet:
the first incarnate, an important figure in the history of Tibet, was regent
for the VIII Dalai Lama from 1757 to 1777; the second was regent for the
IX and X Dalai Lama from 1810 to 1819; and the third was regent for
the XIII Dalai Lama from 1886 till he was in 1895 deposed and thrown into
prison by the young Dalai-Lama, who took the government in his own hands.
The monastery remained always hostile to the XIII Dalai Lama. - L.P.J.
In 1912 it was destroyed by the Tibetan government because it had taken
side for the Chinese. Afterwards the Post Office of Lhuga was installed in
its premises. The De mo Qutugtu latterly lived in isde. H.R.). According
to the DSGL, p. 33 (= VASILTEV, p. 27), hsTan rgyas glis and the other
three royal monasteries were built by the srid skyorl (regent) of Tibet, which
means that they must be later than 1642. Cf. J. Bacot, La vie de Marpa,

for the VIII Dalai Lama from 1777 to 1784; a second incarnation was the all-
powerful ruler of Tibet under the X and XI Dalai-Lamas from 1819 till he
was deposed and exiled to China in 1844. . L.P.).
º bi sde or gi sde. From what we can glean from the ancient texts
and from the accounts of the European travellers, it seems that there existeil
in Lhasa two schools or monasteries of this name. The first, and perhaps
the more important one, was installed in the Ra mo c'e (Ra mo c'e'i bai ade)
by the Ty'al pa Kri dpon da' bde baan po (14th century), who is mentioned
by the VSP, f. 116b und by Sum-pa. The existence of the second, on which
we have but few details, is proved by Das, Dictionary S.V.who tells us
(without however mentioning his authority) that a bZi sde grwa Is an college
was founded in Lhasa at very early date by four monks coming from four
different regions. Perhaps we can identify it with the building called Sidi
in the plan of DAs, Journey, p. 216 1. 4. C. SP. p. 308: VSP, f. 116b:
DSGL, p. 32 (- VASILTEV, P. 26). S. CHAPMAN, Lhasa the holy city, p. 99.
mentions the college of Shiday », depending from the abbol of Rwa sgren
Since the word Rwa sgren is placed in our xyl. as a note to the name of bži
ade, I think we can safely identify the bži sde of our guide with this college.
[One statement of Miss Ferrari requires modification. There never were two
hi sde schools, but only one, as it is clear from all sources. On the other
side, there were two Ra mo e e, as expressly stated by Desideri (MITN, VI,
p. 260), one of which is the well-known monastery and the other is but another
name for the bzi sde, as shown by the VSP, f. 116b and SP. See on the
whole problem my note on bži sde in MITN, I, pp. 218-219. - L.P.J.
To The apelling of this name is very uncertain. The most common spelling
in the Tibetan texts is rMe ru, which occurs in the VSP, in SP and in the
DSGL. European authors call it usually Meru. Moru or Muru. In BUSTON,
p. 184, there is also the form Maru, which is the earliest and also the
earest to that in our text. This temple is very ancient and its foundation
is said to go back to the time of Sron btsan sgam po, since Buston and
Sum pa affirm that in this temple Ton mi Sambhota gave final shape to
the Tibetan alphabet. Besides, the texts say that this temple was one of



the two which Ral pa can caused to be built on each of the four cardinal
points of Lhasa; he placed also there the monk community. There was also
another Me ru, built by king Ral pa can and the Chinese emperor on the
frontier of their two countries, as a peace sign not to be overstepped: Tucci,
Tombs, pp. 26-27). On this account perhaps our temple is called Lhasai
Me ru. The temple was built in the eastern part of the city (along with the
other temple called Karu), to the East by South of the Ra mo e e, inside the
walls. The two temples and the dwellings of the monks were destroyed by
Glan dar ma and then were rebuilt in the present place. [Old Muru (Mu ru
rñia pa) is situated to the East of the gTsug lag k'an near the P'a la house.
It is a residence of the gNas e'un c'os skyont when he visits Lhasa. New Muru
(Mu rugsar pa) is said to be on the site of an old rnam rgyal me od rien and
of a cemetery (dur k rod). - H.R.). The community was reconstructed after
Alisa's arrival in Tibet: it went over to the dGe lugs pa at the time of
the III Dalai-Lama bSod nams rgya mtso (1543.1589). According to Sum
pa, the monks of the rMe ru were gron meog, i.e. wandering monks. The
monastery is still connected with an important school of Tantrism, called
TGyud smad (this name is given in an interlinear note of the xyl.), i.e. the
Lower Tantric School, as a counterpart to the Upper School near the Ra mo e'e.
[rGyud smad is reputedly very strict in discipline. All monks including incarnates
have to spend much time travelling, carrying their own baggage. It also
has the bighest reputation for learning, and the Gyud smad mk'an po is reco
gnized as one of the potential candidates for the office of Kºri Rin po e'e of da'
Iden.. IL.R.). For some time the head of the Meru was also head of bi sde
(see above, n. 69), but after 1684 the two schools were separated. The head of the
Me mu too, like those of the four royal monasteries, could be appointed regent
of Tibet. [As a matter of fact, it is not on record that he ever actually
was.. L.P.). See the plan of Lhasa in WADDELL, Lhasa, p. 331 n. 34 and
the plan of Das, Journey, p. 216 (Muru). Cf. BUSTON, p. 184, VSP, I. 1161 :

71 The Rigs gaum mgon po, or Protectors of the Three Mystic Families,
are the most deeply venerated triad in Tibet: Avalokitesvara, Vajrapāņi and
Mañughoşa. Three stone statues of these gods were found also in the temple
of Samada; WADDELL, Lamaism, p. 355; IV, VI, 1, p. 102. The ms, on the
contrary, mentions no statues, but a chapel dedicated to the three mystic
families under the name of Go Iha, Gods of the Gate. [There is a small

72 The Cos rgyal is Sroh btsan sgam po. The ms. adds: w and the Klu
palace behind the castle. To the north. behind the Potala (hence its name)
there is a small circular temple in the middle of a pond. According to
Desideri, it was founded by the VI Dalai-Lama (1683-1706): MITN, VI,
p. 29 C. Bau, Religion, p. 130: Das, Journey, plan on p. 216, where the
temple is given the name Jumkiolukang: WADDELL, Lhasa, pp. 312 and 375

above, n. 66). [But it never gave a regent to Tibet. . L.P.). It is situated
to the south of Lhasa, on the southern bank of the Kyid e'u; Grib is the name
of that tract of country. A monastery existed there since early times. A cave
of Grib is mentioned in DT. Ca f. 3a - ROERICH, D. 331): and Grib

I do not know whether itse me og glin is on its site. . H.R.).
T4 The name Ka d'en (= ka ba c'en po) seems to indicate the head of
a ka ba (pillar), a title bestowed on the more important monasteries depending
from a central monastery: ef. TPS, table in front of p. 84, n. 2. The same
title of Pillar (ka ba) was given to the four disciples of Klu mes: DT, K's
1.6 - ROERICH, P. 74). Mar pa's four chief disciples were known
as Mar pa'i ka e'en (the Great Pillars of Mar pa): ROERICH, p. 73n. Nothing
can be said on this Ka e'en, because none of the persons of this name met
with in the sources at my disposal can be identified with him. We have a
Ye ses rgya mto who was a Tantrie master (DT, Ga Ef. 4a, 27a [= ROERECH,
pp. 109, 159]), an abbot of Gyal Tha kan of the 14th century (DT, Ka
E. 13a [ ROERICH, P. 92]) and other lumas or abbots of the 17th and 18th
centuries (TPS, p. 69: VSP, f. 199a: SP, p. 304; Reºu mig: ete. [There is
also the Cubzan Blama Ye Bes rgya mtao, a dGe lup pa master whose
works are listed in Tohoku 6562-6566. . LP.). But none can be connected
with Ts'e me'og glin. He should be indeed its founder, since our text by
the term residence of usually refers to the monastery founded by someone.
According to Professor Tucci, Ts'e mc og glih is not very ancient.
75 Spelt by the Westerners as Drepung, Depung, Dabung, Breebung (De.
sideri). We find also in the DSGL, p. 31 (= VASILYEV, p. 24) the form "Bras
dkarspuns pa. This monastery, or rather monastie town, is about
5 miles to the West of Lhasa and has a population of seven to eight thousand
monks. Formerly it was the political centre of the Yellow seet, its abbot
being the recognized chief of the dGe lugs pa: and even after the abbet
became the Dalai Lama and the Potala was built, "Bras spuis remained one
of the four most important monasteries of Tibet. The Tibetan texts are
unanimous in attributing to 'Jam dbyans e os rje bkra sis dpal ldan pa (see

below . 79), a disciple of Tson ka pa, the foundation of "Bras spuis on
the pattern of u Tantric monastery of India called Sridhänyakataka; hence
the honorific form dPal 'Bras spuis which is very frequently met with. The
foundation date is certainly me spre'u 1416, corresponding (as pointed out
by the VSP, f. 55b) to the 59th year of Tson ka pa. According to the same
text, Nam mkabzan po, administrator of Neurdson. participated in the
foundation; cf. SP, pp. 300-301. . In the year so pag 1419 Tson k'a pa him.
sell preached the Law at "Bras spuns and endowed the monastery with a
chair for the teaching : DT, Ba f. Ba [= ROERICH, p. 1078). Before his de.
parture, he also consecrated there the Tantrie temple; TPS, p. 433. The
monastery underwent various vicissitudes in the course of Tibetan history.
It was repeatedly destroyed and as often built up again. We shall recall the
destruction during that war between dBus and Tsai in 1618 (SP, p. 163
and TPS, pp. 655-656); that by the Mongols in 1635 (TPS, p. 61); and the
saek by the Mongol troops of Lha bzari Khan in 1706 (PHTECH, China and Tibet.
p. 13). "Brus spuna is divided today into four colleges (grwa tsari), grouped
around the great temple or assembly hall (is'ops c'en lha k'art or tsogs kah)
which was rebuilt around 1735, after having collapsed on account of grand
age (TPS, p. 656). Each of the four colleges is governed by an abbot and
is concerned with the teaching of a particular branch of the Doctrine. In the

studied in the last two colleges. Tibetan sources say that the colleges of
Bras spus were formerly seven: the four above mentioned, plus Dul ba,
Sag skor and Tos bsam glin (or rGyal pa). From the VSP, 1. 108b, we
gather that at that time (1697) they were still functioning, while later texts,
and particularly SP, p. 305, inform us that already in the 18th century those
three seminaries were in decadence and had no separate and characteristio
teachings any more. The most recent description of the monastery is by
Tucci, Lhasa, pp. 89-91. See also TPS, pp. 39, 53, 61, 433, 655 etc.;

TT The Lotsava of Rwa was the most famous of the masters who taught the

childhood the goddess Remati (Revati) hud placed him in her sleeve and taken
him round the country for two months. Later he became a monk and studied
chiefly in in Nepal with the teacher Mahakaruņa, belonging to the spiritual
lineage of Naropa. He perfected himself in the cycles of Yamantaka. Vajra.
bhairava, Samvara, Vajrayogini ete. (the DT gives the list of the works and
of the cycles studied by him). His knowledge of the Indian doctrines was so
perfect, that the translations he made afterwards were judged, according to
the DT, as the most perfect from the point of view of the interpretation of
Indian thought. He displayed a tremendous activity as translator, teacher
and restorer of temples and monasteries whose libraries he enriched with
countless books. He took part also in the great council of the masters of
dBus, Tsai and Kams organized by king Tse Ide of Guge in 1076; but
because of dissensions with his colleagues, Rwa Lotsava went to India and
Nepal along with his friend the Lotsava of Kan. He had a great number
of disciples who carried on his traditions for a long time. His biography is

81 Se ra (sometimes Ser ra), with the complete name Se ra Teg c en
glid or Se ra Cos sdins, is a monastery or monastic town situated about 2!
miles to the north of Lhasa, in a valley to the foot of the hills. The monastie
population numbers, as it seems, more than six thousand. The numbers given
by Tucci, Lhasa, p. 102, for the inmates of the three great monasteries Bras
spuns (7700), Se ra (6600) and da' ldan (3300) have merely a conventional
value. The name of the monastery is explained literally as the site
of an enclosure of roses: VSP, f. 55b. Only in WADDELL, Lamaism, p. 269.
we find a rather odd explanation of the spelling Serra, which is said to
mean misericordious hail », destroying the rice, i.e. "Bras spuns, Se ra's
rival monastery. But this interpretation seems to be merely a popular joke
on the continuous clashes between the two monasteries. The spelling Ser
ta itself is probably the result of a doubling of the r: but when the names
99



of the three great monasteries are cited together in their abbreviations, the
spelling is always Se.. Se ta was founded in sa pag 1419 by Tsoh k'a pas
dinciple Byams e'en e os rje Sakya ye Sea of To al guh tun, who founded aloo
* monastery called Ha yan si in China. A short biography of him is found
in SP, p. 306; on the Chinese monastery see also VSP, f. 112. The foundation
took place in the 6th year of Tson k'a pa and included several buildings,
among which a temple and the four colleges called Se ra stod, Se ra smad,
Gya and "Broh sten. The SVP, f. 116a, informs us that the community
numbered (in 1697) about 2850 monks, and gives us the list of the abbots
SP, p. 307, gives the names of five colleges (the above, plus Se ra byas pa).
but adds that at his time the two colleges of Gya and "Broni te had merged
with Se ra stod. Nevertheless the colleges were still four, because he mentions
also the one called Naga pa, connecting it with the name of Lha bran
Khan (ruler of Tibet 1700-1717), who had caused a new assembly hall to be
built at Se ra. The passage of Sum pa is not very clear; we might suppose
that this college had been founded by Lha baan Khan, the more so that
the VSP, which is slightly earlier, does not mention it. Afterwards the
number of colleges was redueed to three (Byes pa or Se ra byes: Se ra smad:
Nags pa), on which number all modern authors agree, with the exception
of our text which divides Se ra into two colleges only. Perhaps it leaves
out of account the smallest of the three, ie. Nags pa. Se ta smad gives
elementary teaching: Byes pa, the largest of the three, is reserved to the
wandering monks, chiefly from Eastern Tibet with some Mongols; sNags pa gives
instruction in esoterie mysticism. See E. KAWAGUCHI, Three years in Tibet.

Dar "P'yar (other spellings: mDa p'yar, "Dar p'yar, Dar pyar, "Dar pyar),
his relations with the p'ur bu are not well determined. According to WAD.
DELL, Limeism, p. 269, he was an Indian sage to whom the dagger belonged
originally, before it was found in Tibet. Aceording to the DSGL, p. 34 (=VA.
SILYEV, p. 27), he was the gter ston who discovered the dagger in agter ma.
On the other side SP, p. 307, leaves out the name of this ascetic and calls the
dagger « the p'ur bu of dPal e en xDo rje głon nu , i.e. Vajrakumära, a form of
Heruka, a god who is the pur bu personified (see TPS, p. 588) and who
protects the Nin ma pa and the Sa skya pa. Moreover, from the Tibetan
texts it appears that there were two persons of the same name, belonging
to two different periods. DT, Ca f. 8a, mentions one Dar 'p'yar Lha btrun
pa who made a sacred trumpet, which was blown by Ausa [ROERICH, p. 256.
misunderstood this passage. - L.P.J. A Grub t'ob Dar pyar is also
cited in connection with Rin c'en bzan po among the Siddhas who
meditated in the Jo nan valley: Re'u mig, p. 61. On the other side the
chronicle of the V Dalai Lama and the Hor d'on "byun of "Jigs med rol pa'i
rdo rje (HUTX, p. 77) mention one "Dar pyar contemporary with Sa skya
Pandita; he was a great magician, who aided the Pan e en in conquering the
Indian hereties. The first author gives him the title slob dpon, the second
the title grub t'ob. There were thus two ascetion with the same name, se
parated by an interval of nearly two centuries. Considering the historical impor
tance of the Grub t'ob "Dar pyar of the times of Sa skya Pandita, it is
likely that the dagger had belonged to him.
84 This statue is mentioned also in the DSGL, p. 34 (- VASILYEV, p. 27)
under the name of Padma yad gan drag po, and in SP, P. 307, under the
name of Ta mgrin yan gan yub yum, made of rose-wood (? the text is

MP'a bon k'a (also P'a bon k'ar) is one of the most ancient sacred places
of Tibet. According to the DSGL. P. 34 (- VASILYEV, p. 27), it is situated
on a rock to the north of Lhasa on the slope of the hills [West of Se ra). At
first it was a meditation place of king Sron btsan agam pe, who caused a nine.

it became the residence of the first Tibetan monks, the famous seven sad mi.
The small community which gathered there was then destroyed by the perse.
cution of Glan dar me, and the place remained deserted for a long time. After
wards the community was resurrected and the hermitage was completely restored
during the rule of "Pags pa (1265-1280). Another destruction took place
in the course of a war in a sa pag year (1359? 14192), and Tege'en Cos kyi
Tgyal po (1349-1425: ef. TPS, p. 703 n. 810) restored it. Later Je bDe legs

7 Devikoja is the name of the temple of Kamakhyā near Gauhati in
Assam, a famous Hindu shrine consecrated to Kali, which has entered the Ti.
betan Buddhist tradition as one of the 24 tirtha (places of pilgrimage). For
the convenience of Tibetan pilgrims, the sacred places of Buddhism were, so
to say, transferred toward the Indian frontier and assimilated to already
existing shrines; later they were even simply reproduced in Tibet. Such was
the case of P'a bon k'a, a Tibetan copy of Devikoța, which in its turn had
been asimilated to Kulinagara. Several copies of the same holy place existed
in Tibet (WADDELL, Lamaism, p. 310) and it is on account of this that Pa
bon k'a is called the second Devkota. According to WADDELL, Lamaism.
p. 307 sqq.) a block of stone carried thither from the original place in Assam
was venerated at P'a bon k'a. On the 24 tirthas see Tucci, A visit to an

* Brag yer pa is a rocky hill to the North East of Lhasa (Trayerpa or
Dagyoba of the mupe), where some hermitages are built or excavated in the
rock. It is one of the earliest and most important religious centres, where
shrines were built since the earliest times of the monarchy. K'ri leam
of Mon, one of the wives of Sron htaan sgam po, caused a temple to be built
there (KD, A, f. 6a) and later also king K'ri son de brtsen founded some
hermitages (DT, Ka f. 22a-b [= ROERICH, p. 44]: SP. p. 173). After the
103



persecution of Glan dar ma, Klu mes with his disciples founded there a temple
(Yer pa lha k'an) in 1011 or in 1020; DT, K'a f. 6a - Roerich, p. 74):
SP, p. 179. There was also a Yer pa Pos dga' founded by Mul yer pa:
VSP, E. 125a; SP, p. 309. At Yer pa Alisa gave a complete exposition of
the Doetrine: DT, Ca f. 9a [ ROERICII, pp. 259-260]. The DSCL, p. 35
(= VASILTRV, pp. 28-29), says that at time (early 19th century) there were
about 300 monks and that the place served as summer residence for the monks
of the Gyud stod, the Tantrie school of the Ra mo e'e. Tucci, Lhasa, PP.
106-110, give a description of Brag yer pa: sce also the photo opposite p. 70.
[Yer pa of course is the general name of the valley containing this locality
and the other ones mentioned in the following notes. - P.A.).
* The Zla ba pug cave here mentioned is famous, because Padma.
sambhava ( rgyan Rin po e e) meditated there and concealed some gler ma
in it; TPS, p. 547; TOUSSAINT, P. 375. Near the cave there is the cell in
which Atisa meditated. On the Survey maps we find two places marked
to the south of Brag yer pa: Yerpaphu (Yer pa pʻu) to the north of the river
and Yerpada (Yer pa mda") to the south. [The map is wrong: Yer pa da
too is really to the north of the river. - P.A.).
" TUCCI, Lhas, p. 110, mentions this image of Padmasambhava, to which
worship is offered by drinking can in a cup made of a human skull. The
DSGL, p. 35 (= VASILYEV, p. 28) mentions a statue of Avalokitesvara, whose
fingers exude drops of ambrosia; a mari of white stone on black stone: a
white Tara: a statue of Maitreya which is included among the four great
Maitreyas of Tibet : ete. See also the description of Tucci, Lhasa, pp. 109.110.
The DSGL, p. 35 (VASILYEV, P. 28) mentions the cave of the 80
magicians. The other two cannot be found in the texts knowe to me. One
of the cavea is described as that of Lha lun dPal gyi rdo rje, the murderer
of king Glan dar ma. Perhaps this is the rDo rje p'ug. If so, it contains
the Five Buddhas carved on a central pillar with the word gaigs on it. . II.R.L.
* The temple containing this chapel is certainly the one which Klu mes
and his disciples built in 1011 or 1020 (see above, 11. 95) and in which they
placed the images of the Sixteen Arhats coming from China or copied from
* Chinese model. The importance of this chapel is due to the fact that the
cult of the Sixteen Arhats in Tibet seems to have had its starting point here:
see TPS, pp. 555 ff. The date of this event cannot be ascertained. From
DT, K'a ff. 6a-b, 12a [ROKRICH, pp. 74, 88), we can only infer that the
activity of Klu mes and of his brother is to be placed during the 64 years
preceding the arrival of Ališa in Tibet (1042), and that in me sbrul 1017
Klu mes was still alive, since Sol nag tao po d'e was built in this year
with his permission. Moreover, DT, Ka L. 6b, states that Klu mes built
other monasteries before his death, among which that of Gra p'yi Ts on 'dua.
We ean thus suppose that he died about 1020. C. also SP. p. 179. (From my

tains very few elements of historical interest. His name is linked with the
foundation of Tw'algun tall and of other lesser monasteries, such as Seb

Ts'a ba gru in Kyid sod in cuyos 1123 and died at Gun t'an, where

Brag yer pa. It was founded by Bla ma Zan (see above n. 104) in 1175
(Re'u mix, p. 48). During several centuries it was the fiel of the Ts'al pa
family, which actively participated in the religious and political struggles of
Tibet and was protected by Qubilai Khan. The construction of the complex
of the monastery took several years and was carried on by the successors of
Bla ma 2an. They received from Qubilai the territory of Ts'al, the revenue
105



of which was allotted to the construction of the several buildings and to the
restoration of the temples. According to the Re'u mig. p. 43 (cf. DT, NA
(137b (ROERICH, p. 714]), Bla ma 2an built in 1187 the temple of Tsal
gun t'an and the great statue of the god (the e'en). He began also with the
erection of the ku bum me od rlen (SP. p. 159), mentioned in our text:
it was carried out by his successor Dar ma grags. The latter built also the
mGon k'an (tabernacle) mentioned in our text, and placed a reliquary in it:
TPS, p. 629. Later the dPon c'en Rin rgyal, who received from Qubilai the
investiture of the districts of dBus and Tsah, commenced the construction of
the Eastern Palace (gZims kan sar pa) and of the Grand Court; his son
Ga bde founded the Mantra school in the Bus glin and the logical school
in the Cox "k'or glin (SP, pp. 159 and 309: VSP, f. 1225-125a). The son of
the latter, Mon lam rdo rje, built the chapels of "Od sal 'Perul and of
the ba' 'gyur in the Bus glim, and carried out much work in the temples
of Lhasa. His son Kun dga' rdo rje (religious name: dGe ba'i blo gros)
summoned to Twal the master Bu ston for the consecration of the baº gyur,
of which the monastery possessed three copies according to the Nar tan re-
cension (DT, C'a f. 6a [ ROERICH, f. 338]). The colleges into which Tx'al
un t'ah was divided were called: Yan dgon, dBus glin, Cos köri lho loog.

belonged at first to the ba' brgyud pa. Then it became de lugs pa and
was burnt down in 1546 (Re'u mig: p. 72), probably during the wars between
the "Bri gun pa and the de lugs pa (TPS, p. 14). Cl. also TPS, pp. 630

107 dGaldan, Kenda gompa of the Survey maps, Gaden, Ganden. Gahdan.
Galdan, Gadan of the Western travellers, is one of the three great monasteries
of the Yellow seet. It was founded by Tson k'a pa himself at about 25
miles to the East-North-East of Lhasa, on a high hill to the south of the
sKyid e'u. According to the DSGL the hill is called dBai hskur ri; ae-
cording to the VSP, f. 35b and KD, Za, f. 13b: "Brog ri or "Gog pa ri. (The
hill "Brog ri may be the southern spur which shelters the monastery.. H.R.).
WADDELL, Lamaism, p. 268, calls the hill dBan "k'or. It was founded in the
year sa glan 1409 (SP, p. 233) after the celebration of the smon lam, on the
"Brog ri hill; DT, Ba f. Tb (= ROERICH, p. 1077): VSP, f. 55b. Some years
later, in 1415, Tson k'a pa himself built there the outer chapel (Pyi'l mc od
kal) in which be placed some mandalas made of jewels: DT. loc. cit.: SP.
p. 298 (Grub me od glsun k'an): DSGL. P. 37 ( VASILYEV, p. 30). His
successors, of which the VSP, ff. 60a-79h, gives the complete list down to
1684, carried on the work of the founder, by the construction of buildings
and the consecration of statues. At first two direct disciples of Tson k'a pa
founded the two colleges called Byan itse and Sar rtse, which exist to this
day. The first was founded by Hor ston Nam mk'a dpal bzan po, born in
Mal dro (or Mal gro) in e'u glan 1373 (VSP, £. 79b; SP, p. 297), who was also
the first Bla ma of the college. Sar rtse had as its founder and first Bla
ma Na brtan rin tayal ba, known by the name of Sar pa Rin c'en rgyal
mts'an (VSP, f. 80a: SP, p. 297). The Byan rtse college was later restored
by the 30th K'ri tog of dGaldan, C og rje Blogros rgya mtso, who
it the name of Toa bsam glin (VSP, f. 72a; SP, p. 298). The DSGL states
that formerly there were three colleges and not two. But the name of the
third is not to be found, unless it be that Tantrie School (rgyud grwa) often

disciple of Tson k'a pa. It is rather odd that our text should dedicate to
Galdan only a couple of lines, although from an ideal point of view this
in the most important monastery of the Yellow seet. This is perhaps due
to the fact that the author, being a Sa skya pa, did not wish to dwell over.
much on this monastery, whose political importance after all has never been
considerable: for the vicissitudes of dGaldan in the political struggle
of the 16th and 17th centuries see TPS, pp. 44 ff. and 618 r.- In
contrast with the custom followed in the other foremost Tibetan monasteries.
the abbatial chair of dGaldan is transmitted neither by heredity nor by
incarnation. The rector (Keri tog or Kri Rin po c'e) has always been
chosen from among the most learned monks; Dt. Ba f. 8b [-ROERICH, Pp.
1079-1080). From the list of the abbots given by the VSP and by the DT
we can infer that the term of office of the Kéri t'og has not always been
107



seven years. Among the first abbots there were some who kept their seat
for 10, 11, and even 13 years. Only after about the middle of the 16th cen.
tury the term became more or less fixed at seven years. The rector of da'
Idan is often chosen among the lamas presiding over one of the colleges. He
may be empowered to act as the Dalai Lama's vice-gerent when the latter is
absent; BELL, Religion, pp. 184-185; WADDELL, Lamais, p. 268. According
to the texts the number of the monks in residence at daldan oscillates
between 2000 and 3000. The conventional number given by the Tibetans is
now 3300; TUCCI, Lhasa, p. 102. A good description of da' ldan ibid.. pp.

the colleges see KD. Za f. 19.b. L.P.].
101 A long list of the buildings and of the sacred objects of daldan is
given by SP, pp. 289-299, and by DSGL, pp. 36-37 ( VASULYEV, pp. 29-30).
Foremost among them is the golden stopa enshrining the relies of Tson k'a pas
it is called mT'on ba don ldan; VSP, p. 58: SP, p. 298. It is placed in the
chapel built by the successor (Gyal ts'ab) of Tson k'a pa. Originally it was
made of silver, but it was replaced with a golden ene by Guri Khan's
grandson Blo bzad bstandsin, who for this purpose imposed on the province
of Kams a tax in gold; SP, p. 298. The stupa i, enclosed in a Mongol tent
of sandalwood and felt, dedicated, as it seems, by Ts'e rin don grub, the
commander of the Dungar army who invaded Tibet in 1717: BELL, Religion,
p. 100. But according to a note in SP. p. 298, this tent was offered by
Byams een cos rje. The temple in which the tent is found, was in 1629

stepping stone toward the rebirth of the Religion, was sGyel at La mo, founded
in sa bya 1009. According to VSP, f. 133b, and SP, p. 310, Klu mes had
founded also La mo Tser gseb, which in the 17th century was occupied by
married monk, perhaps it is the same monastery. A La mo Byan o'ub lag

KD, "A f. 18a. The Re' mig gives us the name of a La mo bDe c'en founded

112 rGya ma K'ri k'an, Tigang in the Survey mape, lies to the south of
the sKyid cu and to the south-east of La mo, in the valley of the Gya ma
tin river (Gyamashing of the maps). The region is called in the Tibetan
texts rGya ma' k'ri "og: VSP, f. 132b; SP, p. 310. frya ma Keri kai is
now held by the Hor kan family. The enclosure is surrounded by high walls
and includes the castle of the official, some small hovels for retainers, and
two chapels with some large me od rien in them. One is said to be that of
the bka gdams pa "Gro mgon Sans rgyas the same as rGya ma Sans rayas

small lhe kon called Gyal po k'an, containing an image of Sron btsan sgam
po, who is said to have been born in a house nearby. . H.R.). There are
several monasteries in the rGya ma region. Foremost among them is Rin c'en
gan (or Gya ma Rin ngan or slag rtse'i Gya ma rin agan) founded by Neu

the same as dGyer sgom een po (1090-1171) of the DT, Ca f. 33a (ROERICH,

nastery was rebuilt in 1181 by Sans rgyas dbon ston, one of its abbots (the list of
them is given in [DT, K'a ff. 338-34a (= ROERICH, pp. 315-317) and VSP

to the Tombiri marked by the maps in front of Rin c'en gan, on the farther

also a hill in gTsant called Gya ma Ne'u k'a.

texts also the spelling Mal dro or Mas dro; the latter is regularly em-
ployed in the VSP. This is the valley named Metoma (Mas dro smad?)

(Tangkya Gompa, farther to the north on the Kyid c'u). The Mal gro valley
therefore still keeps the pious foundations made by Sron btsan sam po.
since the VSP and BUSTON, p. 184, attribute the construction of ska tsal and
of Tan skyn to that king. Ka tsal (today a dge luge pa monastery) was
built by the order of the Nepalese wife of Sron btsan sam po, along with
three other monasteries which were meant to keep down the she devil iden-
tified with the Tibetan Territory: these are the four monasteries of the four
sides. [The dgon pa proper of ska ts al consists of two chapels. I was told
it was founded by Padmasambhava after subduing a klu. Quite near, on the
Northern side, is the t'ugs dam gyi gisag lag kun, attributed to Sron btsan
Sgam po. It is a small simple structure with the appearance of great age,
the only building I have seen in Tibet which struck me as really ancient and
untouched. It contains a silver prayer wheel said to have belonged to Sron
btsan agam po. There is also a stone alleged to utter grunting noises; and a
very strictly protected me od rter of the klu is in a small annex. - H.R.).
Tan skya was among the monasteries which were intended for «taming the
frontiers >>: it was later restored by Klu mes: it belonged to the Jonah pa
and later to the de lugs pa: SP, p.310. [T'an skya is now connected with
the rNam rgyal grva ts'an at the Potala. It is said that the original chapel
was on the hillside to the North of the present dgon pa, and that when the
latter was built three ancient clay images from Sron btsan sgam po's original
foundation were brought to the new building. There are also several old bronze
mc od ren of the sort which appears in many bka' adams pa foundations. -

is called Karkha (spelling uncertain), one comes to a low pass, the gNam

West down a deep valley called Gom nan, which enters Ne mo g2u. This is
a long oblong Valley (hence its name), fertile and providing really fine grazing
as well as good crops. There are several large estates and some dgon pa, but
none very large. Opposite sGom nan is dBu (or "U) rgyud dgon pu. Between

more open, cultivated and wooded country. This is part of sNe mo: I cannot

far from a dgon pa of 100 monks called dGe d'e (perhaps a wrong spelling

chants mystiques de Kanha et Saraha, Paris 1929. - L.P.).
T01 The rus rgyan is an implement for the Tantrie cult of good, to be
performed in cemeteries. It consists of a sort of apron made of pieces of
human bones. Description in Tucci, Cronaca della missione scientifica Tucci
nel Tibet occidentale (1933). Rome 1934, p. 155.

Tos mTi'ur puis Tsurphu of the maps it should really be some
miles further East) : DSGL p. 20 (=VASILYRV, p. 23). Dus gsum mk'yen
pa, on whom see the following note, founded it in 1187, and since
then it remained the chief seat of the Karma pa. Its main temple
was built by Karma Paksi in 1263. Cf. Dr. Na f. 32a (RORRICH, p. 1801
Rew mig. p. 55; TPS, pp. 85, 91; Tucci, Tombs, p. 77: H. E. RICHARDSON.
Three ancient inscriptions from Tibel, in JASB Lett. XV (1949), pp. 50, 62.
To The Karma pa seet derives from Dus gummk yen pa de 'p'el
(1100-1193) of Kams, a disciple of Gam po ba; DT. Na f. 32a-34a (= Roz-
RICH, pp. 474-480]. Being divided into the two branches of the Black Hats
(2wa nag) and Red Hats (Zwa dmar), the Karma pa were addicted more to
the hard austerities of Haghayoga than to dogmatic studies. Afterwards they
became the chaplains of the princes of Rin spuns and entered the political
arena. In the 15th century they were the leaders of the fight against the
de lugs pa, who were organising the aristocracy of dBus menaced by the
power of the Rinspuns chiefs. In the early 17th century the Karma pa
supported the last struggle of the Tsan princes against the V Dalai Lama,
168



after the debacle of 1642 their political role was over. TPS, pp. 30. 91
(where the dates of Dus gsur mk yen pa should be corrected), 682.
705 The monastery of Nas nan, Nenang gompa of the maps, was founded
only in 1333 by Grags pa sen ge: DT, Na f. 56b = ROERICH, p. 530): Re'u
mig, p. 59. [The Survey maps place gNas nan much nearer to the Tod lun
valley than to m Tsur pu: but the position given by our text is the correct
one. - P.A.). The line of the Pa' bo Lamas began about 1440 with Pabo
Cos dban Thun grub. The historian dPa bo gTsug lag 'p'ren be was the
second of the line. · H.R.].
T06 The ma, adds: the residence and the relics... Toge Idan Grage
pa sen ge (1283.1349) studied at mTz'ur p'u and gSan p u and was a pupil
of Cos rje bDe c'en. In 1333 he founded the monastery of Nas nau. DT. Na
A. 53b-57a (= KOERICH, pp. 523-532). (According to KD. Za I. 30a he was
the sixth hierarch of the Zwa dmar pa. - L.P.]. [But the Karma pa themselves
number their incarnations from Dus gsum mk yen pa us first 2wa nag pa, and
Gruga pa sen ge as first Zwa dmar pa. One may compare the extended spiritual
Tineage ascribed to the Pan een Rin po d'e, which would make Blo buah
e os kyi rgyal mts'an not the first, but the seventh Pan c'en. - H.R.).
he "Dsam glin rgyan image of the Buddha made by Karma Paksi is
very large and has a noticeably flat head. Otherwise it is of the usual design.
It is said to contain relies of the Buddha, hence its honorific title. - H.R.).
708 Karma Paksi (1204-1283), of the Karma pa seet. was one of
the Tibetan lamas who obtained high favour at the court of Jubilai; HUTH,
pp. 136-137. CF. DT, Na f. 37a [= ROKRICH, p. 487] and TPS. P. 682.
[He was the successor of Dus gsum mk yen pa and is reckoned as the eighth
hierarch of the 2wa nag: KD, Za f. 29. - L.P.]. [Karma laksi is always
accounted by the Karma pa themselves as the second zwa nag pa incarna
tion.. H.R.L.
TO The Zwa nag pa incarnate is known as the rGyal dhan Karma pa.
The reference here is perhaps to Dus gsum mk yen pa and his successors, whose
reliquaries and images are preserved at mTsur piu in impressive surroundings..
H.R.).
710 [There is a large hermitage high up on the hill on the North of
m'T's'ur p'o, which is said to have been that of Rah byuh rdo rje: it is therefore
Padma k yun rdson, although I did not record its name. - H.R.J.
Thi Ran byur rdo rje (1284-1339), ninth hierarch of the 2wa nag, was
the teacher of g-Yuh ston pa. In 1332-1334 he stayed at Peking. Some years
afterwards he went again to the Chinese capital and died there. His life in
told in DT, Na Ef. 38a-40a (= ROERICH, pp. 488-493), and in HUTH, pp. 167.
169. Cf. also KD, Za f. 29b. - L.P.). [Ran byan rdo rje is accounted by the
Karma pa as the third 2wa nag pa incarnation. - H.R.).
